This is a mirror (http://www.fipa.org/repository/index.html) of the FIPA specifications to preserve access for the community.

FIPA specs are a collection of standards that describe a full featured infrastructure for intelligent autonomous multi-agent systems. 

I will try and provide some pointers and information on them in the coming weeks but I have downladed them and mirrored them here because the source repository seems to be periodically unavailble.
